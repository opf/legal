Version: 2020-01-12

> *Data protection and information security are of central importance in our company and are one of the main motives for the development of this open source software. We are very proud of the results so far, but we still need to reduce our “data privacy debt”. We intend to invest a lot of energy and time into this. Our goal is to bring OpenProject to perfection as a lighthouse project for "Data privacy made in Europe".* We have gone to great lengths to make this policy as clear and simple as possible. We want you to understand everything. You should not have to struggle through many pages of incomprehensible legal text. We would therefore be very pleased to receive your feedback and perhaps even an exchange of ideas on the topic of data privacy and security. In this sense, this privacy policy is also consistently subject to an [open source license](https://github.com/opf/legal/blob/main/data-protection/data-processing-agreement/de.md).

## Preliminary comments

The purpose of the OpenProject application is to improve the results of a project team. It is about networking people so that they can work together effectively towards a common goal. The processing of personal data is a fundamental prerequisite for the use of the OpenProject application.

A considerable advantage of the OpenProject application as open source software is the great freedom that the open source license grants to users and developers. This gives every user the possibility to view the source code of this software, to modify it and to install and operate it within their own infrastructure.

Another major advantage is the portability of the OpenProject application and the data processed within it. This means that the owner of the data can decide what infrastructure to run the software on and whether to commission a data processor to operate and maintain it. This is a crucial difference to proprietary cloud applications, where the manufacturers do not grant this option.

The development of OpenProject as open source software is the most decisive and far-reaching technical and organizational measure to protect your personal data. Each OpenProject user is therefore able to decide individually whether to transmit personal data to us.

If a visitor visits our website, contacts us, uses our SaaS platform or uses our software provision service, the processing of certain personal data is required.

This processing is always carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and in compliance with national data privacy regulations.

We have implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of your processed personal data. Nevertheless, any technology may have security vulnerabilities, meaning that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed.

## Legal bases for the processing of personal data

The processing of your personal data generally takes place after consent, according to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. An exception applies in those cases where obtaining prior consent is not possible for practical reasons and we are permitted to process the data by law. If the data processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, this is performed on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Data processing based on our legitimate interest is governed by Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. In addition to the data privacy regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data privacy apply in Germany. These include in particular the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).

## Rights of data subjects

If we process your personal data, you are a data subject within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR with the following rights that can be asserted against us:

We will then cease to process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for our processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.

If you wish to exercise such right, please contact our Data Protection Officer by e-mail. We request that you encrypt this email - this encryption is, however, optional.

# 6\. OpenProject Community Platform

For the networking of the open source community and for the further development of the OpenProject application, OpenProject operates a publicly accessible [OpenProject entity](https://community.openproject.com/) within the OpenProject SaaS platform, i.e. users can view the public content of other users without logging in (e.g. forum posts, bug reports, requirements). Prior registration of a user account is required to create a contribution.

## Scope of data processing

### Registration of a user account

Creating a post on our SaaS platform requires the registration of a user account. In this process, we collect and process the following personal data:

- Name
- E-mail address
- User name
- IP address of the accessing computer

### Optional authentication via external authentication providers (Google)

**For authentication vis-à-vis OpenProject, you can alternatively use your existing Google account. However, we recommend that you refrain from using Google services to protect your personal data**.

When you register, you will be redirected to servers of Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. During this process, your IP address and other personal data will be collected by Google. It cannot be ruled out that data will also be transferred to the USA. For more information about Google's privacy policy, please visit https://policies.google.com/privacy.

### Creating a user contribution

In the project environment, you can exchange information with other users on various topics. In this process, we collect and process the following personal data:

- User-generated contribution
- Date
- Reference to the user's account

### Google reCAPTCHA

**The use of Google reCAPTCHA is a relic of old times (data privacy debt). We are currently working on the complete replacement of this service.**

In the community platform, users can register a user account independently and without manual approval by a moderator. To prevent misuse by automated programs (bots), we use the Google reCAPTCHA service during registration. For this purpose, Google reCAPTCHA analyzes your website visit based on various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as soon as you access the registration form. For the analysis, various information (e.g. IP address, the time you spend on our websites or your mouse movements) is evaluated. The data collected during the analysis is transmitted to Google. In this context, it cannot be ruled out that Google will also transmit the information to a US server. Further information on Google reCAPTCHA as well as Google's privacy policy can be viewed at: https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/

The legal basis for the processing of the data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our necessary legitimate interest lies in the prevention of abusive behavior on our websites. The use of Google reCAPTCHA increases the degree of reliability of the entries made on our websites and leads to an acceleration and simplification of our workload.

**Right to object**

> According to Article 21 GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time with effect for the future, for example by sending an e-mail to privacy@openproject.com. We will then cease to process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for our processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
>
> You are not obliged to provide your personal data. The provision is neither legally or contractually required nor necessary for the conclusion of a contract. However, failure to provide this information could result in you not being able to use our websites or not being able to use them to their full extent.

## Legal basis

The legal basis for processing your data in connection with the OpenProject Community Platform is, in addition to your consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, our legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. It is our legitimate interest to process the comments you have written in the context of our community platform.

### Right of withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future without giving reasons, for example by deleting your contribution. In this case, however, you will no longer be able to access our systems.

### Right to object

> According to Article 21 GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time with effect for the future, for example by sending an e-mail to privacy@openproject.com. We will then cease to process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for our processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.

## Purpose of data processing

Since we do not check the user contributions on our websites before they are activated, we require the data collected in order to be able to take action against the author in the event of legal violations.

## Duration of the storage of your personal data

The user can delete his user account independently. The following personal data will be deleted:

- Name
- User name
- E-mail address
- Telephone number for sending one-time passwords via SMS
- OATH secret code (e.g. for the 2FA app FreeOTP)

The comments and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on this environment until the commented content has been completely deleted or the comments have to be deleted for legal reasons (e.g. offensive comments). Provided you have deleted your user account, all posts created will be assigned to an anonymous collective user. Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.

# 7\. OpenProject Release API

The Release API allows users of a self-hosted OpenProject application to check if a new software version has been released.

**The collection is for statistical purposes only. The calling IP addresses are anonymized so that no conclusions can be drawn about individual OpenProject installations. Also, no data is passed on to third parties at any time, in particular no personal data.**

## Scope of data processing

To check for the availability of new software versions, users with administrator rights will see an update banner on the start page of the OpenProject application as well as on the administrator page. This banner is used to dynamically send a request to the Release API. The availability of a new version is derived anonymously from the transmitted data.

The Release API call includes only the following information:

- IP address of the calling computer (is not stored)
- The type of installation packages used: Installation packages, Docker, manual installation (anonymized storage)
- The current version of the application (anonymized storage and evaluation)
- The database version (anonymized storage and evaluation)
- Activation status of the Enterprise Edition (anonymized storage and statistical analysis)
- Browser type (will not be stored)
- Device and connection data (anonymized storage and statistical evaluation)
- Location information (anonymized storage and statistical evaluation at the level of a country)

For anonymization of the call, the call contains a randomly generated identification code. This ensures that an environment is not statistically recorded twice.

## Legal basis for the processing

The legal basis for processing in connection with the OpenProject Release API is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

## Right to object

You can disable the call of the Release API in your OpenProject entity by unchecking "Administration > System Settings > General > Show Update Security badge" or by setting the `security_badge_displayed: false` configuration policy. For more information, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.openproject.org/system-admin-guide/information/#security-badge).

In case of deactivation of the automatic check, it is up to you to check the availability of new versions manually.

## Purpose of data processing

The purpose of this feature is to avoid buggy and insecure OpenProject applications and to focus the development teams on the operating systems and installation options used.

## Duration of the storage of your personal data

Server logs are stored for a maximum of 90 days.
